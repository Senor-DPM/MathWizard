#MathWizard

Problem Statement: Applications exist for small children to practice basic maths, but they are helpful for kids of class 3 and below. It's difficult to find an app that helps students in senior sections practice their concepts.
MathWizard makes sure that students of any class and age are able to practice any Mathematics topics and concepts anywhere.
